# Voice binaries

These binaries were taken from the [DSharpPlus](https://dsharpplus.github.io/natives/index.html) website
and [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net/tree/dev/voice-natives).

**NOTE**: You need to rename `libopus.dll` to `opus.dll` before use, otherwise audio client will complain about missing
libraries.
